	<dt>Burpee</dt>
	<dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat
	and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.

	<dt>Plank</dt>
	<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the oor.
	Hold the position as long as you can.

	<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the oor in a push up position, then bring one
	knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).
